# Spring Data - October 2022

The **_"Spring Data"_** course examines in detail the operation of the Hibernate ORM technology, which is practically the standard for ORM in Java applications. Hibernate enables mapping between a relational database and an object-oriented model (Java classes) through "database first" and "code first" approaches, and provides a powerful object-oriented API for database queries and performing CRUD operations from Java. Spring Data, on the other hand, builds on the standard API even further and provides both an additional level of abstraction and an easy way to process the data from the database. The course demonstrates established practices in building the database layer of complex systems in Java applications through built-in implementations of the Repository template and the use of the service layer (Service Layer), as well as import and export to various data formats (JSON, XML).

**Skills acquired after completing the course:**

- Building an application architecture properly
